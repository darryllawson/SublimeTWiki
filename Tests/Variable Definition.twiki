The basic variable definition:

   * Set BLAH = 1
   * Local BLAH = 2

Can have WikiWords:

   * Set BETA = this is a WikiWord

Can have links:

   * Set BETA = [[link][name]]

Can have formatted text:

   * Set FOO = *bold* and _italic_ and =raw=

Can reference variables:

   * Set ALPHA = like this: %BLAH%

Can have html:

   * Set BETA = <a></a>

Can appear within comments:

<!--
   * Set BETA = text =raw=
-->

The variable name must be all capitals, aplhanumeric and not start with a
digit. These are NOT valid:

   * Set lower = 100
   * Set 2ALPHA = 100
   * Set ALPHA:BETA = 100

The format needs to be exact. The following do NOT work:

  * Set BLAH = 2
   * set BLAH = 3
   * Set BLAH  = 4
   * Set  BLAH = 5


Some weirdness; HTML can be multi-line:

   * Set BETA = <!-- multi-line
comment -->

   * Set BETA = <b>
bold</b>
