---+ Wiki Word Linka

Wiki word links should be highlighted as links (usually underlined and/or italic):

	WikiWords
    AnotherWikiWord
    SoC - three characters are enough for a wiki word

These are not wiki words:

    AAaBar
    A1Bar
    A1aBar
    Aa1Bar

They can have a web prefix:

    Web.WikiWord
    WebName.WikiWord
    AnotherOne.WebName.WikiWord
    A.WikiWord - yep, web name can be a single character

Web name prefixes must begin with a capital; these aren't valid:

    nogood.WikiPage

Wiki words can also be formatted:

    *like WikiWord*
    =or WikiWord=

But a wiki word cannot start immediately after text formatting punctuation. The following are not valid:

    *WikiWord*
    =WikiWord like this too=

Actually, a wiki word must be preceded by whitespace. These aren't wiki words:

    ^WikiWord
    {WikiWord
    [WikiWord
    /WikiWord
    "WikiWord
    'WikiWord
    .WikiWord
    !WikiWord
    <nop>WikiWord
    !WebName.WikiWord
    <nop>WebName.WikiWord.
    %WikiWord
    %RED%WikiWord%ENDCOLOR%

But, it can be preceded by a (:

    (WikiWord


---+ Forced Links

Forced links look like this:

    [[A link to somwehere]]
    [[wiki#syntax]]
    [[Main.TWiki groups]]

They can appear anywhere on the line: [[Link]]

They can have variable references:

    [[Main.%VAR%]]

They can be escaped with a !:

    ![[wiki syntax]]

But <nop> can't be used to escape them:

    <nop>[[wiki syntax]]


---+ Named Links

Named links look like this:

    [[link][label]]
    [[#AnchorLink][label]]
    [[http://gnu.org/][GNU]]

The label can contain formatting, but there need to be a space before the ]]:

    [[LinkHere][formatting: *bold* =raw= ]]

The label can include variable references:

    [[Link][a %VARIABLE%]]
    [[Link][%WITH_PARMAS{a="1"}%]]

The label can contain HTML and comments:

    [[http://gnu.org/][<b>bold</b> <!-- comment -->]]

The link part can also have variable references:

    [[Link.%VAR%][name]]

A link can be escaped:

    ![[#Anchor][blah]]

But not with <nop>:

    <nop>[[#Anchor][blah]]

Having two links on the same line is allowed:

    [[link][name]] [[link][name]]
