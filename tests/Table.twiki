| *title1* | *title2* | *title3* |
| A | B | ^ |

The line must start with a | to | be a table so this is not a table |.

But leading and trailing white space is fine:

  | see | this | is | fine |

A single | on a line does not make a table either.

A backslash can be used to split a table row over two lines. This is a valid table:

| A | B | C \
| D | \
E |
| ^| b | c | d | e |

| A | B | C | D \
A \
| ss |
