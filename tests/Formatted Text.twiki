Use bold to test the basic formatted text matching:

*YES*   NO*

*YES, including BOTH trailing stars**

*YES, including three trailing stars***

**YES, including BOTH leading stars*

*YES * and YES too*

*YES!*

*YES,*


*!YES*

*YES_*

*YES)*

*YES(*

*(YES*

*YES**

Wiki words can be within formatted text:

    *bold WikiWord ...*

    _italic WikiWord ..._

    =raw WikiWord ...=

But a wiki word cannot start immediately after text formatting punctuation. The following are not valid:

    =LikeThis=

    *OrLikeThis too*

Variables within formatted text:

    *bold %VAR% ...*

Links within formatted text:

    *bold [[AbcDef][xxx]] ...*

Formatted text inside other formatted text is not highlighted:

    *bold _italic_ ...*

    *bold =raw _italic_ ...= ...*

    =raw *bold* ...=

Inner formatting terminates parent formatting:

    *bold *inner*  NO*

    _italics _inner_  NO_

    __italics-bold __inner__  NO__

    =raw =inner=  NO=

    ==raw-bold ==inner==  NO==

Overlapping text formatting:

    TWiki allows over-lapping formatting (not nested, overlapping).

    *raw _bold-raw* ..._  NO

    _italic *bold-italic_ ...*  NO

    =raw *bold-raw= ...*  NO
