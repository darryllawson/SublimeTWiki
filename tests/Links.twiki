---+ Wikiword Linka

Wiki word links should be highlighted as links (usually underlined and/or italic):

WikiWords
AnotherWikiWord

They can also be styled:

*WikiWord*
=WikiWord=

They can have a web prefix:

Web.WikiWord
WebName.WikiWord
AnotherOne.WebName.WikiWord

Web name prefixes must begin with a capital; these aren't valid:

nogood.WikiPage

Escape a wiki word with a ! or <nop>:

!WikiWord
<nop>WikiWord
!WebName.WikiWord
<nop>WebName.WikiWord.

<noautolink> Note that we don't do anything for NoAutoLink, except the XML
element highlighting. This is a known limitation. </noautolink>

Punctuation character (such as  '%') pre-ceeding a WikiWord,
escapes it. For examples these aren't auto-linked:

%WikiWord
%RED%WikiWord%ENDCOLOR%


---+ Forced Links

Forced links look like this:

  [[A link to somwehere]]
  [[wiki#syntax]]
  [[Main.TWiki groups]]

Can appear anywhere on the line: [[Link]]

Can have variable references:

  [[Main.%VAR%]]

Can be escaped with a !:

  ![[wiki syntax]]

Note that <nop> can't be used to escape a forced link:

  <nop>[[wiki syntax]]


---+ Named Links

Named links look like this:

    [[link][label]]
    [[#AnchorLink][label]]
    [[http://gnu.org/][GNU]]

Label can contain formatting:

    [[LinkHere][formatting: *bold* =raw= ]]

Label can variable references:

    [[Link][a %VARIABLE%]]
    [[Link][%WITH_PARMAS{a="1"}%]]

Label can contain HTML and comments:

    [[http://gnu.org/][<b>bold</b> <!-- comment -->]]

The link part can also have variable references:

    [[Link.%VAR%][name]]

Can be escaped:

    ![[#Anchor][blah]]

But not with <nop>:

    <nop>[[#Anchor][blah]]

Having two links on the same line is allowed:

    [[link][name]] [[link][name]]
